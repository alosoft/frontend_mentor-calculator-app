- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This is the toughest challenge I tried on Frontend Mentor #frontendmentor. I ui #ui was easy to code but the calculator's functionality was hard to achieve. It took a whole of time to finish.

I used React #react because of the complexity for the challenge, React's Context API for managing state and stored the current theme in Local Storage
